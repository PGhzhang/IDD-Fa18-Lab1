**A lab report by Hanyu Zhang**

## Part A. Set Up a Breadboard

## Part B. Manually Blink a LED

**a. What color stripes are on a 220 Ohm resistor?**

The color stripes are: red, red, black, black, brown.

**b. What do you have to do to light your LED?**

I have to press the pushbutton to close the circut, thus lighting up the LED.



## Part C. Blink a LED using Arduino

### 1. Blink the on-board LED

**a. What line(s) of code do you need to change to make the LED blink (like, at all)?**

On the code, I need to change every LED_BUILDIN to 13, which is the pin number where LED connected to.

**b. What line(s) of code do you need to change to change the rate of blinking?**

In the loop function, change the parameter in delay() to to manipulate the rate of blinkding. For example, mine is delay(1000).

**c. What circuit element would you want to add to protect the board and external LED?**

Add a resistence to protect the board and external LED.

**d. At what delay can you no longer *perceive* the LED blinking? How can you prove to yourself that it is, in fact, still blinking?**

When I change the code to delay(15), which is 0.015s, I can no longer perceive the LED blinking. To prove to myself that the LED is infact still blinking, I can use Burst Mode on iphone camera to taka a series of photos. If there's any phone in this set caught LED off, it would prove that the LED is still blinking.

**e. Modify the code to make your LED blink your way. Save your new blink code to your lab 1 repository, with a link on the README.md.**

### 2. Blink your LED

**Make a video of your LED blinking, and add it to your lab submission.**

## Part D. Manually fade an LED

**a. Are you able to get the LED to glow the whole turning range of the potentiometer? Why or why not?**

Yes, the LED to glow the whole turning range of potentiometerã€‚



## Part E. Fade an LED using Arduino

**a. What do you have to modify to make the code control the circuit you've built on your breadboard?**

I have to change the PWM pin to 11 by changing int led = 9 to int led =11.

**b. What is analogWrite()? How is that different than digitalWrite()?**

analogWrite() sets the PMWpin an analog value(PMW wave). The pin will generate a wave og specified duty cycle untill next call to analogWrite(). Thus, analogWrite() can be used to adjust the brightness of LED. 
digitalWrite() sets the pin to high or low voltage, where high = 5V and low =0V.

## Part F. FRANKENLIGHT!!!

### 1. Take apart your electronic device, and draw a schematic of what is inside. 

**a. Is there computation in your device? Where is it? What do you think is happening inside the "computer?"**

**b. Are there sensors on your device? How do they work? How is the sensed information conveyed to other portions of the device?**

**c. How is the device powered? Is there any transformation or regulation of the power? How is that done? What voltages are used throughout the system?**

**d. Is information stored in your device? Where? How?**

### 2. Using your schematic, figure out where a good point would be to hijack your device and implant an LED.

**Describe what you did here.**

### 3. Build your light!

**Make a video showing off your Frankenlight.**

**Include any schematics or photos in your lab write-up.**
